# DRAFT

For years, our methodology for changing our websites have been relegated to complete redesigns. That redesign consisted almost exclusively of style/layout/color changes. Our content almost never changes. It wasn't just a little nip here and a tuck here either, it was an all or nothing face-lift. You either did the whole site or get out, your small design change isn't worth our time.

This is what I'm calling the "Three Musketeers" approach. It was either "all for one, one for all," or you never got off the ground.

With the advent of responsive web design, adaptive designs and collaborative designs, we have more of an opportunity than ever to change the way we approach our sites and apps. We can and should be looking at our huge sites and apps as chunks. We assign each chunk a value. When we place the chunks on a scale of highest gains to lowest gains, we have a map.

Then through a iterative approach like Karen McGrane said in the UIE podcast, we approach RWD by tackling the lowest hanging fruit with the biggest ROI. In fact, the way our websites look is not even close to the worst problem we are facing. Our most common problem, our most UNIVERSAL problem has been, and will continue to be mobile device proliferation in our industry.

How do we appropriately and responsibly design for this vast array of devices that gets bigger every day?
